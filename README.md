This is a simple chat application built in Java using sockets for communication and JavaFX 
for the graphical user interface. It consists of a server program and a client program that 
connect via sockets.

The server program creates a ServerSocket and listens for incoming connections from clients. 
When a client connects, it spawns a new thread to handle  that  client's  socket.  It  reads
incoming messages from the client and echoes them back.

The client  program  has a JavaFX GUI with a text area to display messages and a  text  field
to enter messages. When sending  a message,  it  gets  sent  over  the socket  to  the server. 
The client runs in a thread so it can listen for incoming messages from the server and update 
the text area.

This allows a single client and server to have a real  time  chat  by sending  messages  over
the socket connection. The JavaFX GUI makes it easy to build a user-friendly  chat  interface.
The project demonstrates Java sockets for inter-process communication and the basics of 
building a client-server application.
